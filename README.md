### Hey, welcome to my profile! 👋

I'm a 22-year-old computer engineering undergraduate from Brazil, currently in my 2nd year.
Apart from looking up stuff about computers and machines in general, I also really like learning about languages (**human** languages) and cultures.

My Github profile, as of now, will mostly be used for working on personal projects to put both the knowledge I get at university and the things I look up myself into practice. Most of my repositories, at least until the code is working to a reasonable degree, will remain private, except for those that are linked to university projects.
